# Working Papers

1. [How Important is Belief Heterogeneity of Households?](https://yanchiu-macro.github.io/files/belief_heterogeneity.pdf) August 2023 <br>
        **Abstract** Macroeconomic expectations are known to correlate with socioeconomic status, but this relationship is absent in most heterogeneous-agent models. I find that, specifically, households with low marginal propensities to consume (MPC) or high elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) update their forecasts faster than others in response to the business cycle. I develop and estimate a heterogeneous-agent model with rational expectations that captures the empirical correlation between beliefs and household characteristics. Compared to a typical calibration that assumes no such correlation, I find that this model implies more amplification and consumption heterogeneity in response to shocks.
2. [Credit Access and Housing Quality](https://yanchiu-macro.github.io/files/credit_and_housing.pdf) (with Diego Cid and Pablo Sanchez) August 2023 <br>
        **Abstract** Would widespread credit access solve housing quality issues? Using data from Mexico, we find a huge effect of credit access - access to mortgage loans for households in the lowest-income decile is equivalent to raising their income to the middle-income decile in terms of improvement in housing quality. This correlation falls for high-income households. We present a heterogeneous-agent model with a discrete housing choice and borrowing constraint to match our empirical facts. In this model, low-income households are differentially affected by limited access to credit as they are more financially constrained. We use this model to study the effect of credit provision and find that housing quality can be improved by 22 percent if all households in Mexico are given access to mortgage loans.
